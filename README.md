## 
A React.js project created to showcase my component-based creation and data visualization skills. 

# Specifications
- React.js
- React Bootstrap
- Material UI
- React Charts

# How to run
- clone repo
- cd into project root
- run 'npm install' (is needed because I did not include the node_modules folder)
- run 'npm start'

If you haven't worked with React, NPM, or nodejs before you'll most likely produce errors and will have to download the necessary components.
