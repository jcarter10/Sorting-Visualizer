## Background
A React.js project created to showcase my component-based creation and data visualization skills by showing how different kinds of sorting methods operate on each iteration.  

Utilizes the following libraries:
- React Bootstrap
- Material UI
- React Charts

## How to run
- clone repo
- cd into project root
- run 'npm install' (is needed because I did not include the node_modules folder)
- run 'npm start'
Note: latest of version of Node.js and Node Package Manager will be required to run this program.
