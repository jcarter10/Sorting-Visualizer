## Background
A React.js project created to showcase my component-based creation and data visualization skills by using different kinds of sorting methods.  

Utilizes the following libraries:
- React Bootstrap
- Material UI
- React Charts

# How to run
- clone repo
- cd into project root
- run 'npm install' (is needed because I did not include the node_modules folder)

* Must have the latest of version of Node.js and Node Package Manager.
