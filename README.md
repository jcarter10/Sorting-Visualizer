## 
A React.js project created to showcase my component-based creation and data visualization skills. 

# Specifications
- React.js
- React Bootstrap
- Material UI
- React Charts

# How to run
Simply download the application, cd into project root, and type 'npm start'. If you haven't worked with React, NPM, or nodejs before you'll most likely produce errors and will have to download the necessary components.
